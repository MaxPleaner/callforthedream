h1. Call Congress Sample Application

A sample application demonstrating how to use the Twilio Client to call congress.


h2. Description

This is a very simple app that uses the "Sunlight Labs API":https://github.com/sunlightlabs/ruby-sunlightapi/ and "Twilio":http://www.twilio.com/ to let people easily call congress right from their web browser. 

All API keys have been switched to "CHANGE ME". You'll need to register for a Sunlight API key, and a Twilio account to use this code elsewhere.
